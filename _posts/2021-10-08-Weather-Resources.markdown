* Weather Forecasting
    - [NWS 7 Day Forecast][2] - The best forecasts produced anywhere. The
      national weather service staffs 24/7/365 and produce forecasts using the
      output of almost every avaliable forecast model.  This is different than
      any private forecast company, which does not nearly have as much staff.
    - [NOAA Storm Prediction Center][1] - Pretty much everything you need under
      one roof especially for mesoscale convective systems (Thunderstorms,
      severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes) throughout the country, but
      especially in the central US. Also includes fire risks and other hazards.
* Air Quality, Smoke and Fire
	- [AirNow.gov][5] - Basic Government created report of air quality. 
	- [AirNow.gov Interactive Map][4] - Current and forecasted map of air quality.
		Great resource for Ozone and PM2.5 and PM10, including contours and
		monitors. 
	- [fire.AirNow.gov][6] - Smoke and Fire location and air quality reports
	- [Basics of Air Quality Index (AQI)][8]
	- [NOAA HRRR Smoke Forcast][9] - 2 day smoke forecast
* Satellites
	- [GEOS East and West Satellites][10] - Not for mobile or slow connections.
* Hurricanes and Tropical Stroms
	- [NOAA National Hurricane Center][11]
* Misc
    - [Mars Weather Insight][12] - Currently offline
    - [Mars weather Curiosity][13]
